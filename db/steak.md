Ingredients
===========
16 oz. Steak
Large Granule Salt
Grapeseed Oil
Rosemary

Directions
==========

If necessary, defrost the steak.  Seal it a ziploc bag and place in cool water. It should be good to go in under an hour

Once the steak is thawed, pat it dry and coat both sides generously with salt.  Wait 20 minutes.

Pat the steak dry once again.  The salt should have extracted moisture from the top layer of the steak.

Rub grapeseed oil into the steak.

Heat up a cast iron pan to 450-500 degrees.  It might be smoking.

When the pan is heated, take it out of the oven.

Coat the pan in grapeseed oil. Place the steak on.  Cook each side for 3 minutes.

Cook until interior is ~140 degrees.
