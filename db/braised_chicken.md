2 Large potatos or many small potatos (halved)

Directions
==========

Cut the skin off the chicken thighs (the skin is disgusting and will get worse after braising)

Season both sides of the chicken with paprika, salt, and pepper.

Place into a large enameled pot, season with grapeseed oil.

Fry chicken until both sides are brown, then remove the chicken and set aside

Deglaze pan with wine, scraping up all the tasty bits. Add garlic, ginger until aroma is unleashed.

Add cilantro and onions, let cook for 1 more minute

Add chicken stock and stir for another minute

Add everything else, potatos first.  Cook for 45 minutes

After everything is complete, extract ingredients.  For a tasty sauce reduce the remaining sauce in the pot.
